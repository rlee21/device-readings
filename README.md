# device-readings

Web API that receives and processes device
readings. There is a requirement not to persist data to disk but rather store in-memory. Thus, in order to avoid possible race conditions, the web server is [WEBrick](https://rubygems.org/gems/webrick) instead of [Puma](https://rubygems.org/gems/puma) because it's single-threaded.
